This is a little demonstration of using higher order functions to
build string matchig rules.  I've used this approach in the past to
build rules that take (as input) short descriptive strings and
determine a classication (bucket) for that text.  Text that didn't
match any rules was simply placed into an "Unknown" bucket.

This approach of using closures grew out of some earlier experiments
with parser combinators.
